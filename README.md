# 3DLattices

This repository contains a few Mathematica and Matlab functions for the calculation of the homogenized material properties of three-dimensional lattice materials.

More details on the homogenization technique can be found in [Stiffness and strength of tridimensional periodic lattices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782512000941)

If you use these routines or you find them useful for your work you are kindly requested to cite the above study as
